                Eugene Ahn was born in Seoul. During high school, she attended a foreign language specialized school, where she strengthened her English and Japanese skills and developed an interest in becoming a globally minded creative.
                She initially studied Design Innovation at Sejong University in Korea, before deciding to transfer to the School of Visual Arts in New York to further pursue her interest in design.
                At SVA, she is studying Graphic Design and has become deeply drawn to the possibilities of creating visually compelling work by combining technical skills
                 with imagination. As she continues to reflect on what she can create through her own abilities, she actively seeks to explore a wider range of design practices. 
                 Her interests extend beyond traditional typography and image making to include coding, motion, and other contemporary forms of visual expression.
                Now a senior at SVA and approaching graduation, Eugene Ahn is motivated to continue expanding her practice and applying her skills to create thoughtful 
                and engaging graphic work.
